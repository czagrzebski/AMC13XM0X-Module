    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document goes over the design of a linear isolation module using the IL300 optocoupler. The IL300 is a linear optocoupler that is used to transfer an analog signal from one circuit to another while providing electrical isolation. The IL300 is a bipolar device and is used in a variety of applications such as analog signal isolation, voltage level shifting, and linear amplification. The IL300 is a versatile device that can be used in a variety of applications and is a good choice for linear amplification due to its high linearity and low distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the IL300 will be used to convert analog signals from the 12V industrial sensor (thermocouples, strain gauges, pressure transducers, time of flight) to the 3.3V ADC input on the ESP32 Microcontroller. The IL300 will be used in a non-inverting configuration to amplify the signal from the sensor and provide electrical isolation between the sensor and the microcontroller. The design will follow the Unipolar Photovoltaic Amplifier Mode of Operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Photoconductive mode of operation is better than photovoltaic mode of operation for the following reasons:\n",
    "- The photoconductive mode of operation has a faster response time than the photovoltaic mode of operation. This is because the photoconductive mode of operation has a lower output impedance than the photovoltaic mode of operation. This allows the photoconductive mode of operation to respond faster to changes in the input signal.\n",
    "- The photoconductive mode of operation has a higher bandwidth than the photovoltaic mode of operation. This is because the photoconductive mode of operation has a lower output impedance than the photovoltaic mode of operation. This allows the photoconductive mode of operation to have a higher bandwidth than the photovoltaic mode of operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IL300 consists of a high efficiency AIGaAs LED emitter coupled to two independent PIN photodiodes. The servo photodiode is used to provide feedback to the LED driver to maintain a constant output which controls the current to the LED emitter. This photodiode provides a photocurrent, $I_\\text{P1}$, that is directly proportional to the LED's incident flux. This servo operation linearizes the LED's output flux and eliminates the LED's time and temperature dependency. The galvanic isolation between the input and the output is provided by a second PIN photodiode located on the output side of the coupler. The output current, $I_\\text{P2}$ from this diode accurately tracks the photocurrent generated by the servo photodiode. \n",

    "A few notes about the circuit:\n",
    "- The $V_\\text{CC}$ signal on both sides of the IL300 should not be the same power supply. This is because the IL300 is designed to provide electrical isolation between the input and output. If the same power supply is used, the isolation will be compromised. Also, the $V_\\text{CC}$ signal on the output side of the IL300 should be at 3.3V to match the input of the ESP32 microcontroller.\n",
    "- Values for R1 and R2 need to be calculated to ensure the proper gain is achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculating R1 and R2\n",
    "The gain of this amplifier is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}} = G = K3 * (\\dfrac{R2}{R1})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$R1$ sets the input signal range in conjunction with the servo gain and the maximum output current, $I_O$ which U1 can source. Given this, $I_{O_{\\text{max}}} = I_{F_{\\text{max}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's assume that the gain value is 1.0, meaning that there is no amplification of the input signal. In fact, we are deamplifying the signal. This is a good starting point to ensure that the circuit is working properly. However, a gain of 1.0 will work just fine for our purposes. Next, the data sheet states that the typical value of K3 is 1.0. This means that the value of K3 is 1.0. Using this ratio we know that $\\dfrac{R2}{R1} = 1.0$, thus $R2 = R1$. Finally, we need to calculate the value of $R1$ and thus we also get the value of $R2$ from the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R1 = \\dfrac{V_\\text{in}}{K1 * I_{F_{\\text{max}}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the typical operating conditions of the IL300, the value of $K1$ is 0.012 and the value of $I_{F_{\\text{max}}}$ is 12mA, $V_D$ = 15V, and $T_{ambient}$ is 25 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](2024-02-10-14-09-48.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can calculate the value of $R1$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R1 = \\dfrac{12V}{0.012 * 0.012A} = 83333\\Omega \\approx 100k \\Omega = R2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus our values for $R1$ and $R2$ are 100k $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Biasing the non-inverting input\n",
    "Because we are not using a rail-to-rail op-amp, we need to bias the non-inverting input to the middle of the supply voltage in order to get the full range of our analog signal. This is done by using a voltage divider. The voltage divider is made up of two resistors, $R3$ and $R4$. The voltage at the non-inverting input is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{inverting}} = V_{\\text{CC}} * \\dfrac{R4}{R3 + R4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 12V signal, we are going to use a $10k\\Omega$ resistor for $R3$ and a $1.8k\\Omega$ resistor for $R4$. This will give us a voltage of 1.8V at the non-inverting input."
